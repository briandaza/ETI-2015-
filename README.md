# ETI (2015) 

I'm starting this repository to share files for data cleaning and analysis of the Peruvian Child Labor Survey, ETI 2015 (Encuesta Nacional Especializada de Trabajo Infantil, 2015).

This survey was conducted by the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics (INEI). Its aim is collect reliable information to support research and public policies oriented to understand and reduct child labor in Per√∫.

# ETI (2015) 

I'm starting this repository to share files for data cleaning and analysis of the Peruvian Child Labor Survey, ETI 2015 (Encuesta Nacional Especializada de Trabajo Infantil, 2015).

This survey was conducted by the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics (INEI). Its aim is collect reliable information to support research and public policies oriented to understand and reduct child labor in Per√∫.

More information on the survey can be found in [this link](https://webinei.inei.gob.pe/anda_inei/index.php/catalog/496 "Encuesta Nacional Especializada de Trabajo Infantil 2015") and the microdata of this and other surveys conducted by INEI [in this one](http://iinei.inei.gob.pe/microdatos/).

I will update my codes occasionally until a decent advance has been done. In the meantime, if you have suggestions or are working with the same data, you can contact me via [dazavbn@gmail.com](mailto:dazavbn@gmail.com).
